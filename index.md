I am interested in improving the efficiency of medical instruments and have done research in the meantime about how certain critical procedures are done, and how they may be innovatively improved. I trust that Computer Science will allow these changes to take place more immediately. I hold a philosophy in which I believe anything and everything has room for improvement, and it is our responsibility to find ways to continuously achieve higher. 
Musically, I play the violin and love to sing, owning a 3-octave vocal range.
