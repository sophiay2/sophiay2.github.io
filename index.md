## About Me

I am Sophia Yang and am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://cs.illinois.edu) through the [Grainger College of Engineering](https://engineering.illinois.edu). I am also pursuing a [Business](https://business.illinois.edu) minor to bridge the gap between business and the technical engineering field. I am a junior and expect to graduate by May 2021 with all studies.

## Interests
I am interested in improving the efficiency of medical instruments and have done research in the meantime about how certain critical procedures are done, and how they may be innovatively improved. I trust that Computer Science will allow these changes to take place more immediately. I hold a philosophy in which I believe anything and everything has room for improvement, and it is our responsibility to find ways to continuously achieve higher. 
Musically, I play the violin and love to sing, owning a 3-octave vocal range.
Hobbies of mine including swimming and bowling, in which my Girl's Varsity Bowling Team won the first West Suburban Conference Championship in the history of Hinsdale Central High School.
